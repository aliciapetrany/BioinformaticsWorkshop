# Welcome to the RU bioinformatics club sponsored R/ggplot2 workshop!

### Some References:
I'm going to walk interactively through all of the code used in this workshop, but if you get lost, all of the code with some brief explanations are here: https://rpubs.com/aliciaprowan/1223724   
   
All files you need are included in this repository, except for the file we are using the make the heatmap. This can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhRcx6eW7gWiO5AjlOEQWSlkeibc9_Fn/view?usp=drive_link   

### Access R Studio
To follow this tutorial, you need access to R-studio. You have two options to do this. First, you can download R/Rstudio. This takes quite a bit of time, so if you'd like quicker access, you can make free account on posit cloud.   
R/Rstudio download (You must download them both!): https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/   
Posit's R-cloud access: https://posit.cloud/

### Get all of your data!
To copy all of the files into your R-studio instance, click on the "terminal" tab above the console, then copy and paste this command with ctrl+shift+c (just ctrl+c alone will not work!)
```
git clone https://github.com/aliciapetrany/BioinformaticsWorkshop
```
Then, switch back to the console, and copy and paste this command if you're using posit: 
```
 setwd("/cloud/project/BioinformaticsWorkshop")
```
 or this command if you have a local R-studio instance:
```
 setwd("BioinformaticsWorkshop/")
```
